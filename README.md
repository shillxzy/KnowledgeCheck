# KnowledgeCheck

A structured and scalable backend platform for managing knowledge testing, built with **ASP.NET Core Web API**, following a **clean layered architecture**.  
This solution is designed to support user authentication, question management, test assignments, and result tracking ‚Äî all via RESTful endpoints.

## üìê Project Architecture

The project follows a 4-layer architecture for separation of concerns:

- **KnowledgeCheck.API** ‚Üí REST API endpoints
- **KnowledgeCheck.BLL** ‚Üí Business logic (DTOs, Services, Validation)
- **KnowledgeCheck.DAL** ‚Üí Data access (Models, DbContext, Repositories)
- **KnowledgeCheck.JWT** ‚Üí Authentication (JWT, ASP.NET Identity)

Each layer has a clear responsibility and communicates only with adjacent layers to maintain modularity and testability.
